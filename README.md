This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common bug in PHP involving unintended array modifications due to pass-by-reference behavior.  The `bug.php` file showcases the issue, where changes made to an array within a function unexpectedly affect other arrays.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.php`, addresses this by creating a copy of the array before modification, preventing unintended consequences.
